## Project Structure
The project architecture itself is divided into two main folders.
- Core: what can be taken to other procs as well 
- Features: the functionality of the project itself
Service.hpp/.cpp contains Service Windows wrappers.
entry.cpp is the main entry point of the application.

## Code style
The project uses the mixed style of Windows / Valve code style.

## Opportunities for expansion
The service has no limitations thanks to the universal base classes, and expansion in any direction is possible. There are no placeholders for future functionality, except for additional control code.

## Time spent
It took about three  hours, of which about half an hour was spent on debugging.
